SQL ANALYSIS ON DEFORESTATION EXPLORATION 
by Oluwabukola Dunno


ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness 
about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has 
obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and 
year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an 
effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from 
successes.

1. GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41282694.9 in 1990. As of 
2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39958245.9, 
a loss of 1324449, or 3.21%.
The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed 
for the year 2016 (which is 1279999.9891).


2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was
31.3766530484109%. The region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & 
Caribbean, with 46.14%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & 
North Africa, with 2.07 % forestation.
In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 32.42%. The 
region with the highest relative forestation was Latin America & Caribbean, with 51.08%, and 
the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% 
forestation.
The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were 
Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.08% to 46.14%) and Sub-Saharan Africa(30.67% 
to 28.79%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, 
the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area 
of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.38%. 

3. COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL
A. SUCCESS STORIES
There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, China. This country actually 
increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 527229.062. It would be interesting to study what 
has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with 
the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the United States, but it only saw 
an increase of 79200 much lower than the figure for China.
China and United States are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look 
at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we aren’t surprised to find a 
much smaller country listed at the top. Iceland increased in forest area by 2.14 % from 1990 to 
2016.

B. LARGEST CONCERNS
Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in 
two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 
to 2016. When we consider countries that decreased in forest area the most between 1990 and 2016, we 
find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The 
countries are Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania. The 5th country on the list is Honduras, 
which is in the Latin America & Caribbean region. 
From the above analysis, we see that Nigeria is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in 
terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in forest area 
from 1990 to 2016. Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the 
decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts.

4. QUARTILES
The largest number of countries in 2016 were found in the 1 quartile.
There were 9 countries in the top quartile in 2016. These are countries with a very high 
percentage of their land area designated as forest.

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
1) There has been an increase in deforestation of the World by 1324449 between 1996 and 
2016.
(2) Sub –Saharan Africa should be focused on because they are losing more forest areas 
rapidly.
 Laws should be put in place to save the deforestation going on in the Sub Saharan Regions, 
also sensitization should be made to the people of this region on the harms of deforestation to 
the country and the World at large.
